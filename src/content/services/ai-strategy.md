## Strategic AI Advisory

Most companies are experimenting with AI. Few are deploying it strategically. We work directly with C-suite and product leaders to develop AI strategies that create durable competitive advantages—not just impressive demos.

## Engagement Model

Our strategy engagements run 4-8 weeks and include:

### AI Opportunity Audit
We analyze your business model, operations, and competitive landscape to identify the top 10 AI opportunities ranked by feasibility and impact. Most clients are surprised by what's actually achievable within 6 months.

### Build vs Buy Analysis
For each opportunity, we map the landscape of existing tools and platforms. We'll tell you exactly when to buy off-the-shelf, when to customize an existing solution, and when you need custom development.

### Implementation Roadmap
A detailed 12-month plan with resource requirements, risk assessments, and success metrics. Your engineering team gets a blueprint, not a vague strategy document.

### Board-Ready Presentations
We prepare executive-ready materials that communicate AI value in business terms—ROI, risk, and competitive positioning—not technical jargon.

## Who This Is For

Series B+ companies with $10M+ ARR ready to make AI a core competitive advantage. Ideal for ops-heavy businesses in logistics, finance, healthcare, and e-commerce.
