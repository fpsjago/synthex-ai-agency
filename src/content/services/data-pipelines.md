## Data Infrastructure for AI Teams

Modern AI applications demand data infrastructure that's not just fast—it needs to be intelligent. We design pipelines that don't merely move data; they clean, enrich, and structure it for optimal model consumption.

## What We Build

### Ingestion Pipelines
We connect to any source: databases, APIs, file systems, SaaS tools, and streaming services. Our connectors handle schema changes, rate limits, and partial failures gracefully.

### Data Transformation
Raw data rarely matches what your models need. We build transformation layers that normalize formats, resolve entities, deduplicate records, and enrich with external data sources.

### Vector Database Architecture
For semantic search and RAG applications, we design and implement vector stores at scale. We've worked with Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant, and pgvector—and know exactly when to use each.

### Real-Time Streaming
For latency-sensitive AI applications, we build event-driven pipelines using Kafka and Flink that deliver sub-second data freshness to your models.
