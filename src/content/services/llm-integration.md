## Enterprise-Grade LLM Deployment

Integrating LLMs isn't just about API calls—it's about building reliable, cost-effective, and accurate systems that your users can trust. We've shipped LLM features for companies processing millions of tokens daily.

## Core Capabilities

### RAG Architecture
We design retrieval-augmented generation systems that ground your LLM in proprietary data. Whether it's a knowledge base, CRM, or document store, we ensure accurate, hallucination-resistant outputs.

### Prompt Engineering & Optimization
Our prompt engineers have developed frameworks for complex reasoning tasks, structured extraction, and multi-step chains that consistently outperform off-the-shelf solutions.

### Fine-Tuning
For high-volume, specialized use cases, we fine-tune open-source models (Llama 3, Mistral, Phi) on your domain data—delivering GPT-4 quality at a fraction of the cost.

### Model Routing
Production LLM systems need intelligent routing. We build orchestration layers that select the right model for each query, balancing quality, speed, and cost.
